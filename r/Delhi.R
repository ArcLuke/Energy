## Q1. Estimate amount of diesel used in generators during a Delhi blackout and compare to transportation diesel use.
## Assumptions
Tdiesel=1.128*10^6 #liter diesel per day in transportation sector
share=0.20  #assume 20% of households/businesses use diesel generators
#dieselContent=36.4 #MJ/L
genEff=4.8*3.78/60  #gal diesel/hr for a 60kW generator x liter/gal x 1hr/60kWh = 0.302 liter diesel/kWh-e
HHElec=191*(1/30)*3.8*10^6  #191 kWh/HH-month x (1month/30days) x (3.8 million HH in Delhi) = kWh/day in residential sector
HHdiesel=genEff*HHElec*share #liter diesel/kWh-e x kWh elec in residential sector * share of HH's using generators = liter diesel per day in residential sector

comElec=5795*10^6*(1/365) #kWh/day in commercial sector
comDiesel=genEff*comElec*share

compare=(comDiesel+HHdiesel)/Tdiesel
nonTdiesel=c(HHdiesel, comDiesel)
compareEach=nonTdiesel/Tdiesel
compare # magnitude comparison between non-Transporation diesel and Transporation diesel during a hypothetical blackout w/ 20% of residential and commercial elec demand met by diesel generators.

## Q2. Comparing Delhi-wide electricity use and production
# Bottom-up elec use data (2009) from Chavez and Ramaswami (2012)
# Note: Data same as reported by Delhi Govt for 2009-2010.
HH=191*12*3.8*10^6*(1/10^6)  #191 kWh/HH-month x 12months/year x (3.8 million HH in Delhi) x 1 GWh/10^6 kWh = GWh/year for Delhi residential sector
Com=5795*10^6*(1/10^6)  # 5795 million KWh annual commercial elec. use in Delhi x 1GWh/10^6 kWh = GWh/year for Delhi commercial sector.
Ind=2991*10^6*(1/10^6) #2991 million KWh annual industrial elec. use x 1GWh/10^6 kWh = GWh/year for Delhi Industrial sector.
