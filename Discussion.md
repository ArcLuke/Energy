## Results

The following section presents results and discussion for each of four stated research objectives. Taken together, our results represent the first comparative analysis of electrical heating and cooling demand at the city-scale, including both OECD and non-OECD member cities.  

### Cooling
A significant cooling signal was detected (90% confidence level) for 35 of 37 cities analyzed. The only cities without a clear cooling signal were Mbabane, Swaziland (elev. 1243m, lat. -26°, long. 31.3°) and Nairobi, Kenya (elev. 1661m , lat -1.3°, long. 36.8°). Both cities are at high elevation, with temperate climates and cool nights, suggesting that electrical cooling is unnecessary much of the year, and thus adoption of capital-intensive A/C is commensurately low. By comparison, Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire had no detectable cooling signal as recently as 2010, but now has a highly significant (99% CI) cooling demand of approximately 3 W/(capita x °C), suggesting recent uptake of cooling appliances. 

In Accra, Ghana, both the effect of temperature on electricity demand, and the significance of that effect are increasing year-on-year. Virtually across the board among non-OECD cities, this trend holds true: cooling demand, both city-wide and per-capita, are higher now (most recent year data is available) than at the start of the period of record (increasing, but not strictly monotonic). Abidjan, Accra, Chandigarh, Dakar, and Metro Manila all have higher demand for cooling today than even just a few years ago (see Table 2 (city-wide) and Table 3 (per-capita)). This suggests significant, latent, unmet demand for cooling in emerging market cities. As incomes continue to rise, so will penetration of A/C, and thus energy demand for cooling. How high it will ultimately go, is a central question of this research. As an upper-estimate, we can presuppose that demand for cooling will reach eventual parity with OECD cities of similar climate on a Watt/(°C x capita) basis. That is, a similar level of indoor thermal comfort is expected. Integrating over the expected CDH for any given city-year, yields a reasonable estimate of total annual energy consumption for cooling. This method can be applied to current-year, historical, or forecast estimates, by adjusting per-capita cooling demand (intensive margin) and cooling-degree hours (extensive margin), along the development spectrum, and considering the effects of climate change, respectively.

As a group, non-OECD cities (n=15) were found to have maxima per-capita cooling demand of 0-12 W/(capita x °C) in all but three cities [^1]. By comparison, OECD cities (n=18) ranged from 10-140 W/(capita x °C) -- creating two nearly distinct sets, with the median per-capita cooling demand **<<ten-times>>** higher in OECD compared to non-OECD cities. Mid-size U.S. cities such as Detroit, MI; Chattanooga, TN; and Omaha, NE; appear to have the highest per-capita demand for cooling, at approximately 100 W/(capita x °C). Table 3 provides a summary of per-capita peak demand for electrical cooling (and heating, discussed next) for all cities in our study 

Returning to the three non-OECD cities with substantially higher per-capita cooling demand than their peer-group, we have: Manila, Philippines at 19 W/(capita x °C); Amman, Jordan at 47 W/(capita x °C); and New Delhi (not to be confused with Old Delhi nor NCT Delhi as a whole; only the relatively new governmental district) at 40 W/(capita x °C). These three cities may be harbingers of what is to come among as incomes rise, and demand for indoor thermal comfort increases, in the other non-OECD cities in our studies, as well as thousands of emerging-market cities worldwide. 

For example, New Delhi (NDMC; the seat of government), has a per-capita cooling demand roughly four times that of neighboring parts of the city. This reflects stark differences in the building stock: many large government buildings have been retrofitted for air-conditioning, a departure from traditional open-envelope building design. Cooling demand in neighboring districts of Delhi will likely catch up quickly, as A/C rapidly becomes commonplace in middle-income households and businesses in all quarters of the city. 

Amman, Jordan has per-capita cooling demand nine times as high as Beirut, although the cities are less than a 140 miles apart and have similar climates (although Beirut is more temperate given its location on the Mediterranean). Both cities are cosmopolitan, but Amman has more concentrated wealth **<insert city-GDP estimate>>**. Cooling demand in Amman is more similar to that of El Paso, TX, USA at 56 W/(capita x °C), than Beirut. Likewise, Manila, a highly cosmopolitan city, and has a cooling demand exceeding that of Singapore.

Looking next to OECD cities, cooling demands were found to range from 10-140 W/(capita x °C). Mid-size U.S. cities such as Detroit, MI; Chattanooga, TN; and Omaha, NE; appear to have the highest per-capita demand for cooling, at approximately 100 W/(capita x °C). Table 3 provides a summary of per-capita peak demand for electrical cooling (and heating, discussed next) for all cities in our study. 

Altogether, 15 of 37 cities were found to have measurable growth in cooling demand over the period of record, including all non-OECD cities except Beirut and Delhi. 11 of 15 of these cities experienced the highest cooling demand on record in the most recent year. This suggests continued, increasing penetration of air conditioning and increasing square-footage of air-conditioned space. The former is likely the driving force in the seven non-OECD cities contained in this group (Abidjan, Cote d'ivoire; Accra, Ghana; Chandigarh, India; Dakar, Senegal; New Delhi, India; Delhi Military Contonement, India; and Manila, Philippines), whereas the latter is more likely in the four OECD cities (New York City, USA; Philadelphia, USA; Tacoma, USA; Indianapolis, USA.). In other words, business and residences in non-OECD cities are rapidly adopting A/C, whereas non-OECD cities have reached market saturation for A/C ownership, but are building and converting more square-feet into residential/commercial air-conditioned space. 

At the city-scale (as opposed to per-capita) demand for electrical cooling ranges from less than 10 MW/°C in Accra, Beirut, Chandigarh, Dakar, Antigua, Kano and Tema, to over 2000 MW/°C in Tokyo. Of course, population and the size of the economy explain much of that difference, but large disparities remain even on a per-capita basis, as noted above. All non-OECD cities, besides Amman, Manila and New Delhi, have per-capita cooling demands less than 10W/(°C x capita), whereas the only OECD city in our study with a per-capita cooling demand in that range is Los Angeles. Los Angeles, however, has a very mild, coastal climate with an annual average temperature of a perfect 72°C. <CONTINUE HERE>.

### Heating

For heating, 23 of 47 cities had a significant relationship between cooler temperatures and increased demand associated with electrical heating.
