## Abstract	
As the tropics and subtropics become increasingly urban, industrial and affluent, it is important to consider how energy demand – particularly for indoor thermal comfort – will evolve differently in these places than it has historically across the global North. Already, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) account for 35% of total primary energy requirements of the United States (Kwok and Rajkovich 2010), and are expected to reach similar proportions in China within 5 years (Wan et. al. 2011). On a per capita basis, developed cities in the OECD (represented in our study by cities in the U.S. and Japan) require 35-90 W/°C (interquartile range) above a comfortable room temperature, while tropical/subtropical cities outside the OECD (mostly in South Asia, Africa and the Middle East) require 2-9 W/°C. The latter is expected to catch up to the former as household incomes rise and adoption of AC accelerates; and someday surpass the former, given higher indoor-outdoor summer temperature differentials.
