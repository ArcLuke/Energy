Many of the world's **largest** and **fastest-growing** cities--from Karachi (pop. 14 million; 34.6% increase from 2000-2010) to Delhi (22m; 39.4%), Dhaka (15m, 45.2%), Jakarta (10m; 14.8%), Bangkok (8m, 29.1%), Lagos (11m; 48.2%) and Kinshasa (9m, 55.4%)--are located in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa with tropical to sub-tropical climates unlike those of most OECD member cities in the global North. As the tropics/sub-tropics become increasingly urban, inustrial and affluent, it is important to consider how energy demand--particularly for thermal comfort--will evolve differently in these places than it has historically across the OECD. 

This repository contains various R scripts used for this and other energy analyses.
