# Temporal Downscaling of Energy Demand Forecasts
Mid- to long-range energy demand forecasts are typically reported as annual totals and provide little insight to the distribution throughout the year. To address this shortcoming, we focus on the diurnal and seasonal distribution of energy demand and supply, which drive system cost but recieve relatively little attention in energy outlooks. This requires more and better data than is typically available to researchers.  

This study presents an empirical analysis of diurnal-to-seasonal energy use patterns for 9 states in Northern India with a combined population of nearly half a billion.  The analyses described here can serve as a methodological template for estimating peak-demand in data-sparse regions throughout South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
